# fal.ai Integration for Image-to-3D Generation

This document describes the integration of fal.ai for image-to-3D generation, replacing the previous Replicate implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
```bash
cd backend
npm install @fal-ai/client
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Add your fal.ai API key to your environment variables:

**For development (.env):**
```
FAL_API_KEY=95638d63-2011-4a66-bf8a-b3647febaf43:cb00658666e670d5ae87a52ce827b874
```

**For production:**
```
FAL_API_KEY=your_fal_api_key_here
```

### 3. Code Changes

#### AIService.js Updates:
- Added fal.ai client import
- Updated constructor to initialize fal.ai client
- Commented out original Replicate 3D generation function (preserved for reference)
- Implemented new fal.ai TripoSR model for image-to-3D generation

#### Key Features:
- Uses fal.ai's TripoSR model for high-quality 3D generation
- Maintains compatibility with existing API structure
- Includes proper error handling and logging
- Preserves original Replicate code as comments

## API Usage

The integration maintains the same API interface, so no changes are needed in the frontend or other parts of the application. The `generate3DModel` function now uses fal.ai instead of Replicate.

### Example Usage:
```javascript
const modelResult = await aiService.generate3DModel(imageUrl, options);
```

## Benefits of fal.ai Integration

1. **Better Performance**: fal.ai's TripoSR model provides high-quality 3D generation
2. **Cost Effective**: Potentially lower costs compared to Replicate
3. **Reliability**: More stable API with better uptime
4. **Quality**: Superior 3D model generation results

## Fallback

The original Replicate implementation is preserved as commented code, making it easy to revert if needed. Simply uncomment the Replicate code and comment out the fal.ai implementation.

## Testing

To test the integration:
1. Ensure the `@fal-ai/client` package is installed
2. Set your `FAL_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Start the backend server
4. Use the existing frontend to generate 3D models from images

The integration should work seamlessly with your existing workflow.
