# Hunyuan3D Integration Guide

This guide explains the integration of Hunyuan3D via fal.ai for high-quality image-to-3D model conversion.

## Overview

Hunyuan3D is now integrated via fal.ai's cloud service, providing:
- Higher quality 3D models than TripoSR
- Better texture generation
- More accurate geometry reconstruction
- Multi-view support for better results
- No local deployment required

## Integration

Hunyuan3D is now integrated directly via fal.ai's cloud service. No local deployment is required!

### How It Works

The system automatically uses fal.ai's Hunyuan3D model (`fal-ai/hunyuan3d/v2/multi-view/turbo`) which provides:
- Multi-view 3D generation from a single image
- High-quality geometry and texture reconstruction
- Cloud-based processing (no local GPU required)
- Automatic fallback to TripoSR if Hunyuan3D fails

## Backend Integration

The Node.js backend has been updated to use fal.ai's Hunyuan3D model:

1. **No additional setup required** - uses existing fal.ai configuration
2. **The service will automatically**:
   - Try fal.ai Hunyuan3D first (highest quality)
   - Fall back to fal.ai TripoSR if Hunyuan3D fails
   - Fall back to Replicate as final option

## API Usage

The Hunyuan3D integration works through your existing backend API:

### Generate 3D Model
```
POST /api/designs/generate-3d-model
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "image_url": "https://example.com/image.png",
  "options": {
    "texture_size": 512,
    "generate_color": true,
    "generate_model": true
  }
}
```

The backend automatically uses the best available service:
1. **fal.ai Hunyuan3D** (primary) - Multi-view generation
2. **fal.ai TripoSR** (fallback) - Single-view generation  
3. **Replicate** (final fallback) - Reliable backup

## Performance Considerations

- **Cloud Processing**: No local GPU required - processing happens on fal.ai's servers
- **Processing Time**: 1-3 minutes per model (faster than local deployment)
- **Quality**: Higher quality than TripoSR with better geometry and textures
- **Cost**: Pay-per-use pricing through fal.ai (no infrastructure costs)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hunyuan3D generation fails**:
   - Check fal.ai API key configuration
   - Verify image URL accessibility
   - Check backend logs for detailed error messages
   - System will automatically fall back to TripoSR

2. **All services fail**:
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify fal.ai and Replicate API keys
   - Check backend logs for authentication errors

### Logs and Monitoring

- Backend logs show which service is being used (Hunyuan3D, TripoSR, or Replicate)
- fal.ai provides detailed generation logs
- Automatic fallback ensures continuous service availability

## Fallback Strategy

The system implements a three-tier fallback:

1. **Primary**: fal.ai Hunyuan3D (highest quality, multi-view)
2. **Secondary**: fal.ai TripoSR (good quality, single-view)
3. **Tertiary**: Replicate Trellis (reliable backup)

This ensures 3D model generation continues even if any single service fails.

## Cost Considerations

- **fal.ai Hunyuan3D**: Pay-per-use pricing (higher quality)
- **fal.ai TripoSR**: Pay-per-use pricing (good quality)
- **Replicate**: Pay-per-use pricing (reliable backup)

All services use cloud-based processing, so there are no infrastructure costs.

## Security Notes

- All processing happens on secure cloud services
- Uses existing fal.ai API key (no additional keys needed)
- HTTPS communication for all API calls
- No local file storage or processing

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Hunyuan3D is already integrated via fal.ai
2. Test the integration with sample images
3. Monitor generation quality and performance
4. The system automatically uses the best available service
5. No additional setup or deployment required!
