# Subscription Payment Update Fix - Summary

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Subscriptions were not updating on the dashboard after payment, and usage limits were not being applied correctly.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **User Model Enhancement** 
- Added missing `enterprise` plan type to enum
- Added `stripeSubscriptionId` and `status` fields to track subscription state
- **File**: `backend/src/models/User.js`

### 2. **Webhook Handler Fixes**
- Fixed User subscription update in `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted`
- Added fallback update mechanism if primary update fails
- Updated all webhook handlers to properly sync User data
- Added comprehensive logging with emoji indicators
- **File**: `backend/src/services/stripeService.js`

### 3. **Usage Limits API Improvements**
- Fixed `checkUsageLimits` to return complete subscription info
- Better handling of free vs paid tier users
- Returns subscription object for frontend display
- **File**: `backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js`

### 4. **Frontend Polling Enhancement**
- Increased polling from 10 to 15 attempts
- Increased interval from 2s to 3s for webhook processing
- Added dual check: both subscriptions AND usage limits APIs
- Better error handling and retry logic
- **File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test
1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. **Start Frontend**: `npm run dev` (in root)
3. **Setup Stripe CLI** (for local testing):
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
4. **Go to** http://localhost:5174/pricing
5. **Click "Upgrade Now"** on Creator or Studio plan
6. **Use test card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
7. **Complete payment**
8. **Watch dashboard update** with new limits!

### Verify Subscription Test Script
```bash
cd backend
node test-subscription-flow.js YOUR_USER_ID
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check your user and subscriptions
- ✅ List available plans
- ✅ Create a test checkout session
- ✅ Display current usage limits
- ✅ Verify User model sync

## 📊 Expected Results

### After Payment:
1. **Dashboard automatically reloads** (within 45 seconds)
2. **Subscription displayed** as "Creator Plan" or "Studio Plan"
3. **Usage limits updated**:
   - Creator Plan: 100 images/month, 50 models/month
   - Studio Plan: 1000 images/month, 500 models/month
4. **Features unlocked** based on plan

### Console Logs (Backend):
```
✅ Subscription record created successfully
✅ User [userId] subscription updated to premium/pro
✅ Subscription checkout completed successfully
```

### Console Logs (Frontend):
```
🔔 Stripe checkout session detected
🔍 Checking for subscription... (attempt X/15)
✅ Active subscription found!
🔄 Refreshing usage limits...
🔃 Reloading page with updated subscription...
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If subscription doesn't update:

1. **Check Backend Logs** - Look for ✅ or ❌ indicators
2. **Check Webhook Secret**: Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly
3. **Verify Webhook Endpoint**: 
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/health
   ```
4. **Check Database**:
   ```javascript
   db.subscriptions.find({ userId: "YOUR_USER_ID" })
   db.users.findOne({ id: "YOUR_USER_ID" })
   ```

### If limits aren't enforced:

1. **Check Usage Limits API**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/payments/users/YOUR_USER_ID/usage/limits \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```
2. **Verify response includes** plan type and limits
3. **Check frontend** `useUsageLimits` hook is working
